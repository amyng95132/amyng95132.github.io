Elizabeth Gaskell was not as prolific as her peer Charles Dickens. But, she portrayed the joy and kindness of humanity in her book, Cranford.  <br> <br>

When an Alderney cow tumbled into a lime-pit, the Cranford community rescued this poor creature and clothed the cow warmly during the winter. You can tell how much these kind-hearted ladies loved the animals.  <br> <br>

Afternoon tea is an English tradition that dates back to the Victorian era. Mrs. Jamieson even let her dog, Carlo, enjoyed the tea with the Cranford ladies. You may think her act is ridiculous but I was amazed. Yes, I am the one who would give drinking water to the animals. <br> <br>

Cranford is a story that painted the real life of the Victorian era. The puffed sleeve was the fashion during this time period. I was fascinated by the gigot sleeves and the turban. While reading Anne Of Green Gables, I wondered why Anne was so fascinated with the puffed sleeves. This is the pinnacle of Victorian fashion. <br> <br>

There is a chapter that truly touched my heart. Peter, a mischievous boy, put on his elder sister’s dresses to mock his sister. I thought this is simply an act of an immature boy making fun of his own sister. It is hard to comprehend why Peter deserved a flog from his father. Peter remained quiet. He went into the kitchen, kissed his mother goodbye, and left. He boarded the ship to the far East. <br><br> 

Deuteronomy 22:5 "A woman shall not wear a man's garment, nor shall a man put on a woman's cloak, for whoever does these things is an abomination to the LORD your God.” This was the reason Peter was flogged by his father who was the rector of Cranford. As a Chritian, I feel the pain of a loving father to guide his son to the right path and honor God.<br> <br>

In brief, Cranford is a short novel where you can take a peep of the Victorian era lifestyle in England. No drama but true friendship and daily life in an English community.
