At primary two, my dad showed me the lyric of Auld Lang Syne. As a 8 years old kid, I didn't quite understand the big word "acquaintance". But, the melody imprinted in my mind. <br/><br/>

Rabbie, a darling poet, who loved the highlands. Here is the poem that comes so close to my heart. A short poem that lingered in my mind when I was in the highland.<br/></br>

My heart's in the Highlands, my heart is not here,<br/>
My heart's in the Highlands, a-chasing the deer;<br/>
Chasing the wild-deer, and following the roe,<br/>
My heart's in the Highlands, wherever I go.<br/><br/>

Farewell to the Highlands, farewell to the North,<br/>
The birth-place of Valour, the country of Worth;<br/>
Wherever I wander, wherever I rove,<br/>
The hills of the Highlands forever I'll love.<br/><br/>

Farewell to the mountains, high-cover'd with snow,<br/>
Farewell to the straths and green valleys below;<br/>
Farewell to the forests and wild-hanging woods,<br/>
Farewell to the torrents and loud-pouring floods.<br/><br/>

My heart's in the Highlands my heart is not here,<br/>
My heart's in the Highlands, a-chasing the deer;<br/>
Chasing the wild-deer, and following the roe,<br/>
My heart's in the Highlands, wherev'r I go<br/>
My heart's in the Highlands, farewell.<br/>
