    <h2>About Amy and her favorite book</h2>
    Johor Bahru, my birthplace, is located on the peninsular of West Malaysia. I was born in this charming fishing village that sits next to the equator.</br></br>

    Since I was a kid, my dad and I have enjoyed drawing, swimming, hiking, and playing music. Piano is my primary instrument and flute is my secondary instrument. Ah! You don't want to hear me play the flute :) <br/></br>

    My dad is my art teacher. He is also my English teacher. We love to venture around the old town and visit the bookstores. We both agreed that the best bookstore was owned by an elderly Indian gentleman in my hometown. This historical bookstore was a 2 stories building and both sides of the old wooden stair were packed with books. 
    Frankly, it's the grandest staircase I've ever seen in my life.<br/></br>

As the third generation of Chinese immigrant, the story of Joy Luck Club is a real life narration of my family history in Malaysia. Amy Tan, the author of Joy Luck Club, graduated from San Jose State University. This is an ivory tower where I spent my 20s to pursue my master’s degree. A piece of paper that I believe would be a glory to honor my grandmother and mother. <br/></br>

Joy Luck Club is a vivid modern history of four young ladies leaving China during the war. They hopped on the ship and hoped for the best in their next destination. This was exactly how my grandmother left her hometown, Guang Dong Province, and landed in Singapore. <br/></br>

I love how the author highlighted the metaphor of the swan feather as a precious gift that a mother intends to pass down to her daughter. The feather is light but the dream of a mother on her daugther is outrageously heavy. <br/></br>

The chain was cuffed on a girl when she was born. She will be married off in the future and denounced her family name. On the other hand, a son is desirable and he will bear the surname even after his death. My parents have two daughters. The failure to produce a son is a lifetime regret that my mother struggles with. <br/></br>

In the novel, there are 4 girls who were born and grew up in the United States. They are the second generation of Chinese imigrant and speak perfect American English. They are well-educated and brilliant. Alas, they are well-aware that they will never be good enough to match their mothers’ standard.  
	As the third generation growing up in Malaysia, I still have the same mind-set as these four girls. I will never be good enough for my mother no matter how hard I try. <br/></br>

The older I get, I realize that I have already done my part to be an ideal daughter. I am fluent in Mandarin, passed all my piano exams with flying colors, obtained a degree, and married a Chinese gentleman.  But, by Chinese standards, I am still not good enough. 

The ideology of a perfect daughter could be unrealistic regardless of the era. All I want in life is a cozy chair where I can snuggle down, browse through my favorite books, and have a cup of good coffee or tea. The world is my oyster. <br/><br/>
