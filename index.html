	<h2>About Amy</h2>
    Johor Bahru, my birthplace, is located on the peninsular of West Malaysia. I was born in this charming fishing village that sits next to the equator.</br></br>

    Since I was a kid, my dad and I have enjoyed drawing, swimming, hiking, and playing music. Piano is my primary instrument and flute is my secondary instrument. Ah! You don't want to hear me play the flute :) <br/></br>

    My dad is my art teacher. He is also my English teacher. We love to venture around the old town and visit the bookstores. <br/></br>

    We both agreed that the best bookstore was owned by an elderly Indian gentleman in my hometown. This historical bookstore was a 2 stories building and both sides of the old wooden stair were packed with books. 
	Frankly, it's the grandest staircase I've ever seen in my life.<br/></br><br/></br>
