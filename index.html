	<h2>About Amy</h2>
    Johor Bahru, my birthplace, is located on the peninsular of West Malaysia. I was born in this charming fishing village that sits next to the equator.</br></br>

    Since I was a kid, my dad and I have enjoyed drawing, swimming, hiking, and playing music. Piano is my primary instrument and flute is my secondary instrument. Ah! You don't want to hear me play the flute :) <br/></br>

    My dad is my art teacher. He is also my English teacher. We love to venture around the old town and visit the bookstores. <br/></br>

    We both agreed that the best bookstore was owned by an elderly Indian gentleman in my hometown. This historical bookstore was a 2 stories building and both sides of the old wooden stair were packed with books. 
	Frankly, it's the grandest staircase I've ever seen in my life.<br/></br><br/></br>

<h2>马来西亚华人</h2>

马来西亚华人不是马来人。马来人是来自邻国印度尼西亚的民族。所以马来人和马来西亚华人都不是马来西亚的土族。<br/></br>

马来西亚华人的历史可追溯到20世纪初。由于战争，男人们离开祖国前往马来亚谋生, 主要是劳动工作, 例如修建铁路, 在港口搬运, 或在橡胶园工作, 他们也被称为苦力。而年轻女子终生不嫁, 成为女仆, 称为妈姐。<br/></br>

男男女女离乡背井, 将辛苦赚来的钱寄回家乡。无论身在何处，始终怀恋故乡。这是中国人的家庭传统。<br/></br>

早期离开故乡的中国人没有受过教育，所以他们不会普通话, 但他们争取让下一代保留中国姓氏, 坚持中华教育。我能读写简体中文, 是祖先们的工劳和血汗。我写这篇短文来纪念我的祖父母和所有贡献中文教育的马来西亚华人。
